Technical Architecture & Business Model Document
Version 1.0
Establishing Novelty, Moat, Viability & Differentiation
1. Executive Summary
1.1 What Refleqt Is
Refleqt is a context-aware marketing artifact marketplace that combines:
Persistent Business Intelligence — An AI system that continuously learns and evolves
understanding of each business customer
AI-Generated Execution Maps — Contextualized marketing campaigns, content strategies, and
technical documentation generated from deep business understanding
Private Paid Marketplace — Execution maps sold as purchasable items, produced by anonymized
creators with performance-tracked reputations
Dynamic Signal-Driven Calendar — A living content pipeline that evolves based on market signals,
platform intelligence, and business context changes
Real-Time Performance Attribution — Granular tracking of every artifact's ROI, enabling
closed-loop optimization
1.2 The One-Sentence Pitch
"Refleqt is a private AI-powered marketing marketplace where your business context generates the
strategy, anonymous creators execute, and every result is tracked in real-time."
2. The Core Innovation: Persistent Business Context
2.1 The Problem with Current AI Tools
2.2 Refleqt's Business Context Layer
Refleqt maintains a persistent, evolving Business Context Profile for each customer with three
distinct layers:
Static Foundation (Captured at Onboarding): Business model & revenue mechanics, target
audience/ICP definition, competitive positioning & differentiation, brand voice/tone/visual identity,
product/service catalog, technical stack & capabilities.
Dynamic Layer (Continuously Evolving): Founder inputs (rants, observations, learnings), market
signals (competitor moves, industry trends), performance feedback (what content worked/failed),
customer intelligence (from connected analytics), strategic shifts (priorities, launches, pivots),
seasonal/temporal context.
Derived Intelligence (AI-Synthesized): Inferred audience segments, content theme affinities, optimal
channel/format recommendations, messaging angle effectiveness scores, competitive gap
opportunities.
2.3 Context Accumulation Sources
3. Integration Model: Plug-In Architecture
3.1 The Anti-Integration Philosophy
Refleqt does NOT require continuous foundational API integration with your marketing stack.
Instead, we employ a plug-in extraction model that respects your existing tooling while building
persistent intelligence.
The Problem with Traditional Integrations: Most marketing platforms demand deep, always-on API
connections. This creates fragility (when one system changes, everything breaks), security
concerns (persistent access to sensitive data), maintenance burden (constant sync management),
and vendor lock-in (your data becomes hostage to connection health).
Refleqt's Approach: We plug into your marketing ecosystem, extract what we need, then
disconnect. The extracted data trains your business-specific contextual model. No persistent
connections. No sync overhead. No fragility.
3.2 The Extraction Process
The integration follows a monthly batch extraction cycle:
Connect: One-time OAuth connection to your marketing tools (CRM, analytics, social platforms,
CMS, email platform)
Extract: Pull relevant data snapshots — performance metrics, audience data, content inventory,
campaign history
Transform: Normalize and structure the extracted data for model training
Train: Feed into your business-specific Contextual Data Transformer
Disconnect: Close active connection until next extraction cycle
3.3 Supported Tooling Ecosystem
4. The Contextual Data Transformer: Per-Customer AI
4.1 What It Is
Each Refleqt business customer gets their own Contextual Data Transformer (CDT) — a fine-tuned
language model that embodies their specific business understanding. This is not a shared model
with customer-specific prompts. It's a dedicated model instance trained on YOUR data.
4.2 Training Data Sources
The CDT is trained on a synthesis of:
Onboarding intake responses
Rant/Vent Board entries (processed and structured)
Extracted tooling ecosystem data (monthly batch)
Historical content performance (what worked, what didn't)
Calendar behavior (what was prioritized, delayed, rejected)
Explicit feedback on generated recommendations
4.3 The Monthly Reinforcement Cycle
The CDT doesn't just train once — it evolves monthly through a belief reinforcement cycle:
Week 1-3: Observation — The system collects all new data: rant entries, performance metrics,
calendar decisions, market signals, and the monthly tooling ecosystem extraction.
Week 4: Synthesis & Training — New data is synthesized with existing context. The CDT
undergoes reinforcement training that updates its "beliefs" about the business: what messaging
resonates, which channels perform, what audience segments respond, what competitive angles
work.
Post-Training: Validation — The updated model generates test recommendations compared
against a holdout set. If quality degrades, rollback to previous version. If quality improves, deploy
new version.
4.4 Belief Evolution
The CDT maintains a probabilistic belief system about the business:
Beliefs that strengthen get more weight in recommendations. Beliefs that weaken trigger
exploration of alternatives.
5. The Rant/Vent Board: Unstructured Context Capture
5.1 Purpose
Traditional business tools require structured input. But founders think in fragments, observations,
frustrations, and epiphanies. The Rant/Vent Board captures unstructured founder cognition and
converts it into actionable business context.
5.2 Input Types & Context Value
5.3 Key Principle
"Every rant is data." The founder doesn't need to think about what's "useful." They just express. The
system extracts value.
6. AI-Generated Execution Maps
6.1 What Are Execution Maps?
Execution Maps are complete, contextualized marketing initiatives generated by the customer's
CDT from their Business Context Profile. They are not templates — they are custom-built for THIS
business at THIS moment.
6.2 Execution Map Types
6.3 Marketplace Presentation
Each Execution Map appears in the customer's private marketplace with:
Title: Clear description of what it is
Rationale: Why this is recommended NOW (context-based)
Contents: List of all assets included
Preview: Sample brief or partial content
Timeline & Price: Estimated production time and cost
Success Metrics: What we'll measure
7. Anonymized Execution & Creator Marketplace
7.1 The Anonymization Principle
Default state: All execution is anonymized.
Rationale: Removes bias from customer expectations, focuses on output quality, enables fair
evaluation of new creators.
7.2 Creator Tiers & Reputation
Creator reputation is built on performance attribution — how their content actually performs after
deployment:
7.3 Premium Creator Bidding
For customers who want access to top-tier creators:
Customer requests access to Elite creators
Views anonymized creator profiles: performance stats, specialization areas, portfolio samples
Places bid for creator time/priority
Creator accepts/declines based on bid + availability
Future: Microcontracts — Granular task-level agreements with performance bonuses tied to
outcomes and priority queue access.
8. Dynamic Signal-Driven Calendar
8.1 The Living Calendar Concept
The content calendar is not static. It continuously evolves based on signals:
8.2 Calendar Layers
Layer 1 — Scheduled: Purchased execution maps with dates, committed content with deadlines,
customer-locked items.
Layer 2 — Recommended: AI-suggested items based on signals, optimal timing recommendations,
gap-fill suggestions.
Layer 3 — Opportunities: Time-sensitive market opportunities, trending topics with relevance,
competitive response windows.
8.3 Notification System
Daily digest: Calendar summary + new signals
Urgent alerts: Time-sensitive opportunities
Weekly review: Performance + recommendations
9. Real-Time Performance Dashboard
9.1 What Gets Tracked
Every artifact produced through Refleqt is tracked from production through deployment to outcome:
Production Phase: Brief created, creator assigned, draft submitted, QA status, revisions, customer
approval.
Deployment Phase: Publish date/time, platform(s) deployed, initial reach/impressions.
Performance Phase (Continuous): Impressions/reach, engagement, click-through rate, conversion
events, revenue attribution, comparative benchmarks.
9.2 Dashboard Views
9.3 The Feedback Loop
Performance data feeds back into the Business Context Profile and triggers CDT belief updates:
Pattern Recognition: What topics, formats, channels, angles perform?
Context Update: Increase weight of successful patterns, decrease underperformers
Recommendation Tuning: Future execution maps and calendar suggestions reflect learnings
10. The Moat: Why This Is Defensible
10.1 Moat Components
10.2 Competitive Differentiation
10.3 The Compounding Advantage
Over time, the advantage compounds:
Time 0: Business Context = Basic | Recommendations = Generic | Switching Cost = Low
Time 6 Months: Business Context = Rich | Recommendations = Targeted | Switching Cost =
Medium
Time 18 Months: Business Context = Deep | Recommendations = Precisely Tuned | Switching Cost
= High
A competitor cannot replicate 18 months of accumulated business intelligence and monthly CDT
training cycles.
11. Business Model & Viability
11.1 Revenue Streams
11.2 Unit Economics
11.3 Scalability Path
Phase 1 — Agency Model (Now): Refleqt internal team produces. Limited capacity. High-touch,
high-margin. Goal: Validate demand, refine quality.
Phase 2 — Creator Marketplace (6-12 months): Open creator onboarding. Anonymized execution.
Performance-based reputation. Goal: Scale supply, maintain quality.
Phase 3 — Full Marketplace (12-24 months): Premium creator bidding. Microcontracts. Self-serve
tiers. Goal: Network effects, market leadership.
